# Application Face detection

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed **Node.js** on your machine. If not, you can download it from Node.js official website.

## Installation

1. Open your console.
2. Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
node server.js

All necessary modules should already be installed. However, if you encounter any issues, you may need to install the required modules manually. Use the following commands:

npm install express
npm install fs

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, make sure Node.js is correctly installed. You can check your Node.js version by typing the following command in the console:

node -v

## Note on Inspect Mode

If you use the inspect mode (F12), the layout might appear messed up. Don't worry, this is a common issue when the window frame changes. Simply refresh the page (`Ctrl + R` or `Cmd + R` for Mac users), and it will update to the new window frame.
